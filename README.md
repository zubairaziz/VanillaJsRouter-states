# VanillaJsRouter

A minimal router made with vanilla JS. Used `onPopState()` and `pushState()` as opposed to my other project where I used hash changes.

## Limitations

Files served are stored in JS documents. I'll probably change it so that it serves html files in the future.

## Notes

PRs welcomed
